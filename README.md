# Making a random name generator

[Detailed explanation of code here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGiggy-G3zS-gPrtpWAenljIaZLpK2-Q1pKVWItFC3I/edit?usp=sharing)

## Problem Statement

1. We aim to build a random name generator that generates new names based on a given dataset of existing names.

2. The generator will use a bigram language model to learn patterns and relationships between characters in the dataset.

## Motivations

1. Creativity Boost: Inspire users with unique name combinations, aiding writers, developers, and businesses in finding
   memorable names.

2. Time Saving: Automate name generation to swiftly produce numerous options, saving users time and effort.

3. Diverse Output: Offer a wide range of name styles and linguistic patterns, ensuring users find names fitting their
   needs.

4. Personalization: Tailor the generator to specific themes, languages, or industries for names resonating with target
   audiences.

5. Learning Tool: Provide insights into language structures and phonetics, serving linguistics enthusiasts and learners.

## Objectives:

1. Accuracy: Develop a bigram model capturing linguistic patterns for natural and coherent name generation.

2. Efficiency: Optimize algorithms for quick and seamless name generation, even with large datasets.

3. Customizability: Allow users to adjust parameters like length, style, and theme for tailored name generation.

4. User Experience: Design an intuitive interface for easy use and satisfaction.

5. Versatility: Ensure easy integration into various platforms for widespread utility.

## Methodology

I am using a bigram model first to generate random names. Later, I will use MLP character-level language model to
produce more human sounding names
